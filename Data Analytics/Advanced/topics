### **📌 Short Notes on Advanced Data Operations & Feature Engineering**  

#### **1️⃣ Advanced Pandas Operations**  
✅ **Merging & Joining** – Used to combine multiple DataFrames based on keys (`merge()`, `join()`).  
✅ **Pivoting** – Reshaping data using `pivot()` (wide format) & `pivot_table()` (aggregated format).  

#### **2️⃣ Handling Time Series Data**  
✅ **Parsing Dates** – Convert strings to datetime using `pd.to_datetime()`.  
✅ **Resampling & Rolling Windows** – Aggregate data over time (`resample()`, `rolling()`).  

#### **3️⃣ Working with Large Datasets (Dask & Vaex)**  
✅ **Dask** – Parallel computing for handling **huge datasets** (`dask.dataframe` like Pandas).  
✅ **Vaex** – Fast visualization & analytics on **billion-row datasets** without loading into RAM.  

#### **4️⃣ Importance of Feature Engineering in Predictive Modeling**  
✅ **Transforms raw data into meaningful features** for better model performance.  
✅ **Improves accuracy** by capturing patterns in the data (e.g., time-based features).  

#### **5️⃣ Creating New Features from Existing Data**  
✅ **Polynomial Features** – Creating squared/cubic terms for non-linearity.  
✅ **Date-based Features** – Extracting year, month, day, or weekday from timestamps.  

#### **6️⃣ Feature Selection Techniques**  
✅ **Filter Methods** – Use statistical tests (`correlation`, `variance threshold`).  
✅ **Wrapper Methods** – Recursive feature selection (e.g., `RFE` with ML models).  
✅ **Embedded Methods** – Models with built-in selection (e.g., Lasso, Decision Trees).
